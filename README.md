# jukebox24
# Authors: Tucker Luadtke &

# This was a group project, in which our goal to make a working jukebox/music playlist that plays at proper time, can queue songs and is visually appealing. I took the opportunity to lead this assignment as I wanted to feel the responsibility of leading a coding project that would count towards a grade and therefore have risks if not taken seriously.
